# Peer Graded Project from Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to collect, work and clean a data set.
It uses data collected from wearable devices avalable from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

the run_analysis.R file loads and transforms the data present in the UCI_HAR_Dataset directory, creates a first tidy data set called result from the raw data, creates a second data set called result2 from the first on by grouping data by activity and subject and taking the mean of each variable from each group.

A complete description of all variables is available in the dataset directory in the features_info.txt file.

All steps performed to load, transform and obtain the tidy data sets are described in CodeBook.md
